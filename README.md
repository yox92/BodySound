# ü¶∂ BodySound ‚Äî Body Volume Tweaker for SPT

## üéØ Description

**BodySound** is a client-side mod for SPT that allows you to **control the volume of local body-related sounds** (footsteps, gear movement, jumping, etc.).

The goal is to enhance audio immersion by reducing certain movement-related audio categories for the local player.

## üîç How it works

The mod intercepts Unity audio playback related to local player movement.  
If a clip name starts with a relevant prefix (`walk_`, `gear_`, etc.), the mod automatically adjusts its volume through:

```csharp
BetterSource.volume = volumeSliderForPrefix;
