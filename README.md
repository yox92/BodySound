# 🦶 BodySound — Footstep & Gear Volume Tweaker for SPT-AKI

## 🎯 Description

**BodySound** is a client-side mod for SPT that allows you to **control the volume of local body-related sounds** (footsteps, gear movement, jumping, etc.).

The goal is to enhance audio immersion by reducing certain movement-related audio categories for the local player.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🎧 Dynamically adjusts volume for audio clips with prefixes:
  - `walk_`, `gear_`, `run_`, `jump_`, etc.
- 👤 Affects **only the local player** — other entities remain untouched.
- 🔁 Based on Harmony patches on `SoundBank.Play()` and `SoundBank.PickClipsByDistance()`
- 🔊 Volume is configurable per clip prefix
-  Lightweight — no performance impact

## 🔍 How it works

The mod intercepts Unity audio playback related to local player movement.  
If a clip name starts with a relevant prefix (`walk_`, `gear_`, etc.), the mod automatically adjusts its volume through:

```csharp
BetterSource.volume = volumeSliderForPrefix;
